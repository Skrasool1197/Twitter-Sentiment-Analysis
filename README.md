# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The objective of this project is to predict the sentiment of tweets using machine learning. Twitter Sentiment dataset from Kaggle was used to train a RandomForestClassifier model to classify tweets as irrelevant, neutral, positive, or negative. To make the model accessible, a simple and interactive user interface was developed using Streamlit.
